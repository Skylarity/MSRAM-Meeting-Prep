# MSRAM Notes - 8/15/2017

## Limitations of current platform

- 32bit -> 64bit
- ESRI dropping support for ArcGIS Explorer (AGX)
- MS Access hitting max capability/capacity (having to drop parts of data)
- No real-time stuff, final data sets only available *once* per year

## Data

- Captain of the Port has the authority to deal with data (? needs expansion)

- Data becomes secret if it contains target name, address, or location
