# D3.js

[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. <sup>[[source](https://d3js.org/)]</sup>

D3 allows the user to dynamically create and update content in a web browser by looping through a data set (or multiple) and applying data-driven styles and transformations to either DOM elements or an [HTML5 canvas](#canvas).

# Canvas

Added in [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/HTML5), the HTML <canvas> element can be used to draw graphics via scripting in JavaScript. For example, it can be used to draw graphs, make photo compositions, create animations, or even do real-time video processing or rendering. <sup>[[source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)]</sup>

We prefer canvas over SVG for performance and flexibility reasons.
